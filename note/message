I've been trying to be
every man you saw in me
but in my eyes
I just flicker out and glare like ghost
before I go
I know
Can you show?
Me a Miracle?
I wish I'd stayed the night
But I've got to go
to America
and this could take a while
isn't it time that I come alive?
isn't this life that I don't know
and so I'll go
and so I'll go
